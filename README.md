#KoC Power Tools

This script is designed for use in conjunction with KoC Power Bot (https://github.com/tomchapin/koc-power-bot) and provides many useful automated functions for the Kingdoms of Camelot Facebook game! 

This script is is maintained by the "KoC Scripters" team, which is the same team behind the KoC Power Bot script. We plan to add a number of new features and improvements to KoC Power Tools, so stay tuned!

##NEWS

This project is no longer hosted on Userscripts.org (which shut down), and is no longer actively maintained on Google Code (which will be shutting down soon). The project has officially moved to Github and will live here for the forseeable future, so please update your bookmarks accordingly.
